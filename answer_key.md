## Section A: Foundation Concepts (72 Marks)

### Q1. (8 marks) - Easy
**Answer: B) Galois symmetry and field conjugation**

**Explanation:** In cyclotomic fields, the Galois group acts by permuting the roots of unity. Since polynomial coefficients are elementary symmetric polynomials in the roots, and symmetric polynomials are invariant under Galois action, they must lie in the base field (rationals). Combined with the algebraic integer property of roots, this forces integer coefficients.

### Q2. (8 marks) - Easy  
**Answer: B) It is its own antiparticle**

**Explanation:** Majorana fermions are defined by the property γ = γ†, meaning the particle is identical to its antiparticle. This leads to topological protection when realized as zero modes in certain condensed matter systems.

### Q3. (8 marks) - Easy
**Answer: B) kT ln(2) joules**

**Explanation:** Landauer's principle establishes that erasing one bit of information requires a minimum energy of kT ln(2), where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is temperature. This is fundamental to the thermodynamics of computation.

### Q4. (8 marks) - Easy
**Answer: C) Gas phase (high temperature)**

**Explanation:** In cognitive thermodynamics, the gaseous phase (π/9 ≈ 0.34) corresponds to high memory decay rates, enabling chaotic exploration and creative thinking by rapidly forgetting old patterns.

### Q5. (8 marks) - Easy
**Answer: C) 1/d where d is the dimension**

**Explanation:** For harmonic configurations, the trace identity forces λ = 1/d, making the covariance matrix C = (1/d)I. This is the fundamental harmonic constant.

### Q6. (8 marks) - Easy
**Answer: C) Sine and cosine functions**

**Explanation:** Transformer positional embeddings use sinusoidal functions PE(pos,2i) = sin(pos/10000^(2i/d)) and PE(pos,2i+1) = cos(pos/10000^(2i/d)) to encode position harmonically.

### Q7. (8 marks) - Easy
**Answer: B) Large spectral gap**

**Explanation:** Ramanujan graphs achieve optimal expansion through maximal spectral gap, ensuring rapid information mixing with minimal connectivity.

### Q8. (8 marks) - Easy
**Answer: B) The sum of all vectors equals zero**

**Explanation:** The centering condition Σvₖ = 0 places the centroid at the origin, removing the "DC mode" and enabling geometric discipline.

### Q9. (8 marks) - Easy
**Answer: B) They have real eigenvalues and orthogonal eigenvectors**

**Explanation:** Self-adjoint operators guarantee measurable (real) eigenvalues and orthogonal eigenvectors, providing stable decomposition essential for quantum observables.

## Section B: Intermediate Concepts (120 Marks)

### Q10. (10 marks) - Medium
**Answer: B) Large spectral gap**

**Explanation:** In oscillator cryptography, a large spectral gap ensures rapid synchronization and makes the hidden geometry computationally intractable to infer from aggregate signals.

### Q11. (10 marks) - Medium
**Answer: C) Conserve symplectic structure (phase space volume)**

**Explanation:** Symplectic Neural Networks preserve the geometric structure of Hamiltonian evolution, not just energy, leading to superior long-term stability in phase space.

### Q12. (10 marks) - Medium
**Answer: C) Hyperbolic (negative curvature)**

**Explanation:** Hyperbolic manifolds have exponentially growing volume, naturally modeling the branching, exponential expansion of future possibilities.

### Q13. (10 marks) - Medium
**Answer: B) The system requires thermodynamic cost > 0 to observe**

**Explanation:** Paving number > 1 indicates irreducible twists requiring non-zero work to resolve incompatible viewpoints, distinguishing reality from cost-free simulation.

### Q14. (10 marks) - Medium
**Answer: D) Obscures well-worn paths, forcing discovery of new routes**

**Explanation:** Strategic forgetting changes the energy landscape by removing familiar solution paths, compelling the system to rediscover truth via novel routes - the "architecture of novelty."

### Q15. (10 marks) - Medium
**Answer: B) Stratified manifold collapse zones with high curvature**

**Explanation:** LLM hallucinations arise from "wobbly bits" - singularity zones with uncontrolled curvature where the geometric representation of language breaks down.

### Q16. (10 marks) - Medium
**Answer: C) It is non-commutative (P+Q ≠ Q+P)**

**Explanation:** Non-commutativity means order matters (like putting on socks then shoes vs shoes then socks), mathematically modeling the irreversible, sequential nature of time.

### Q17. (10 marks) - Medium
**Answer: B) Intelligence is substrate-agnostic, generated by specific operators**

**Explanation:** ASI hypothesis claims intelligence emerges from mathematical operator algebra, not specific materials - it's about the "rules" not the "stuff."

### Q18. (10 marks) - Medium
**Answer: D) Can pair distant elements by viewing indices as cyclic group**

**Explanation:** Spectral pairing transforms linear partitioning to modular selection on a circle, enabling globally balanced non-contiguous partitions impossible with sequential cuts.

### Q19. (10 marks) - Medium
**Answer: B) Riemann zeta zeros are eigenvalues of unknown self-adjoint operator**

**Explanation:** The conjecture proposes that the mysterious zeta zeros correspond to energy levels of some quantum system, connecting number theory to spectral theory.

### Q20. (10 marks) - Medium
**Answer: B) Acts as living Laplacian minimizer, solving network optimization**

**Explanation:** Slime mold physically minimizes a Laplacian-like functional, finding optimal transport networks between food sources - embodying the Symmetry code through physical optimization.

### Q21. (10 marks) - Medium
**Answer: C) Agent uses predictive internal model for irreversible actions**

**Explanation:** Agency requires information-based prediction to guide irreversible choices, distinguishing it from systems that follow direct physical laws without internal models.

## Section C: Advanced Concepts (108 Marks)

### Q22. (12 marks) - Hard
**Answer: C) P vs NP Problem (Collapse code)**

**Explanation:** P vs NP tests the fundamental cost of collapsing possibility space (all potential solutions) to actuality (finding one solution), directly embodying the Collapse code's domain.

### Q23. (12 marks) - Hard
**Answer: D) Gerbe (three-or-more composition failure)**

**Explanation:** Gerbes formalize higher-order obstructions where three or more local solutions cannot be consistently composed, providing the mathematical foundation for computational hardness.

### Q24. (12 marks) - Hard
**Answer: C) Observer resolution geometry equals system spectral redundancy**

**Explanation:** The ODP field equation links the geometry of how observation changes with scale (renormalization group) to the system's internal information redundancy - the informational analogue of Einstein's geometry-matter relationship.

### Q25. (12 marks) - Hard
**Answer: C) Lagrangian submanifold (symplectic geometry)**

**Explanation:** The equilibrium "sweet spots" of the proximity-identity functional form a Lagrangian submanifold - a specific geometric object in symplectic geometry where stable compromises reside.

### Q26. (12 marks) - Hard
**Answer: B) Quantum Extremal Surface holographic encoding**

**Explanation:** QES prescription identifies finite "entanglement islands" that holographically encode essential information from seemingly infinite exterior regions, providing computational manageability for cosmological predictions.

### Q27. (12 marks) - Hard
**Answer: B) Hidden symmetry confines zeta zeros to critical line**

**Explanation:** The non-random, highly structured placement of zeta zeros suggests they are confined by an unknown symmetry principle, reducing their possible locations from 2D plane to 1D critical line.

### Q28. (12 marks) - Hard
**Answer: B) Optimal orthogonal basis preventing eigenvalue collapse**

**Explanation:** Both phenomena draw stability from circle harmonics: cyclotomic fields use circle symmetry for integer structure, while Chebyshev polynomials provide stable harmonic basis preventing attention matrix spectral collapse.

### Q29. (12 marks) - Hard
**Answer: B) Lacks inherent units of physical scale (time/space)**

**Explanation:** Singularity algebra operates on abstract resource/demand concepts without built-in meters or seconds, making it incompatible with scale-dependent cosmological theories.

### Q30. (12 marks) - Hard
**Answer: B) Critical point balancing maximum efficiency with stability for consciousness**

**Explanation:** The boundary synthesizes optimal network properties (Ramanujan) with phase transition physics (Einstein condensation) to describe the sweet spot where consciousness emerges from maximum information integration.
